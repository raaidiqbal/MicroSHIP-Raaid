  
**Project Proposal**

1. Project Title: Next Episode

2. The dataset we are going to work with, Anime Recommendation Database 2020 from Kaggle, contains thorough information about Anime viewership. We will only use the “anime.csv” file. We will be examining the ratings given by users, content tags, and genres to filter through and recommend animes for the user to watch based on an anime that they input that they like.   
3. Metadata:

4. Potential uses  
   1. Users will be able to expedite their own searches for anime by using filters and a search feature to either highlight or remove animes with certain characteristics. 

      A: The users will be those who are seeking the new anime content to watch from 2020 or prior.

      B: This interaction will occur through a search bar and various menus to interact with filters.

      C: This will benefit users by allowing them to use a variety of criteria to find recommendations for anime they want to watch.​​

      D: This could expose users to unsavory content because of the level of control they have over their search.

   2. When feeling less inclined to search on their own, users will be able to receive recommendations based on previous searches or inputted preferences.

      A: Users of this feature would be trying to expand their anime horizons by exploring a large collection of films and shows.

      B: This interaction would likely take place with the click of a button, but newer users may be asked for input in order to better calibrate the function.

      C: This would save anime watchers the time and struggle of searching to find a new show to watch.

      D: Users might feel excluded if the search feature doesn’t include the criteria they are specifically looking for.

   3. Users can rate animes and these ratings will be added to the dataset of ratings.

      A: Users who include people who wish to rate animes that they have watched. One motivation for them may be to influence the recommendation system of the website through their ratings.

      B: They will interact with the data by submitting their own rating for an anime by providing an integer between 0 and 10 which will be factored into the existing rating of each anime.

      C: Future users will be able to more accurately find quality anime because of the abundance of user inputted data.

      D: We feel this feature will be all inclusive because users can add their own rating so that they can influence the existing ratings of animes.
